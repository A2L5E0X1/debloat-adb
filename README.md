# Android Debloatscripts for Bash
Debloat your Android Phone, by GG2501YT

## How to use?
Run the Debloatscripts you want. But before you execute a Script, please edit the script and remove the debloat command of the apps you want to keep or put a # before the line.

## Can I restore the uninstalled Apps?
You can restore some apps by installing the original apk. On some devices like EMUI Devices it doesn't work. If you can't restore the App you want, you need the hardreset the whole device! So please be careful.

## You forgot an App! How can I add it to your Script?
Fork this Repository and do a Pullrequest. If you want to add a Debloatscript for an System that is not available yet, you can also do a Pullrequest. But please use the debloat-example.sh to make your Debloatscript.

## Can I execute this on Windows?
Yes but you need to install Cygwin or a Linux Subsystem (Windows 10 only) with adb

## Which devices are supported?
Any Android Device with ADB. But some devices (for example Fire TV Stick on FireOS) have the uninstall command disabled (It will show INTERNAL_ERROR)

## I've executed a Debloatscript and there were some Errors.
This is normal. Not every device has this apps. It depends on your device and on your ROM.

## Which Apps does the Script install????
All Apps you can install with the appinstall script are opensource and on FDroid.
